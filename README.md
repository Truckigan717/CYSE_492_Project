Repository for work on Veritaz Projects
INSTALLING AND RUNNING:
1) Make sure python 3.7 and git are installed on the host system
2) Git clone git@github.com:Truckigan717/CYSE_492_Project.git
3) Find a dataset you're interested in and save it somewhere.
4) Run aggregator.py(still looking for a flashy name) like this:
`python aggregator.py <dataset.csv>`
5) Give aggregator the name of an output file(with a .csv extension).
6) The Program will list the available rows and columns, select which ones you would like to transport over
7) Coming soon, the ability to write this info to the output file, and append more to it in the future.
